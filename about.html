<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Suyash  and I am a soon to be graduate from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where I studied International Health. In December of 2022, I was eager to begin my job hunt but was frustrated that jobs were posted in so many places. I wanted a centralized place to find early-mid career jobs in International Development. Thus, IHDJobs.com was founded.  Thank you for supporting my page. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me here:</p>
